- Upon completion of the prototype, model had 40% accuracy

- Using a more sophisticated optimizer (adam) than Stochastic gradient descent bumped it up to 80% accuracy, respectable but not good

- Challenge encountered: overfitting
- While the model performed well on the images it was trained on, it had around a 20% accuracy on real world images
- Fixed this by equalizing the amount of images that are cancer negative and positive, while also adding more transforms to images to make model account for outliers



- Even after this, the model still performed poorly on real world data
- VGGs
