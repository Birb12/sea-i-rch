Search is a research project dedicated to optimizing and applying Dual Channel Convolutional Neural Networks for detection and grading of invasive cancer in whole slide images.

This project seeks to find novel algorithms and methods to better aply DC-CNNs on cancer classification and mitotic rate inferring. It also seeks to port the trained DC-CNN model on a microcontroller and design a microscope attachment that can easily read images from a microscope, feed images into the DC-CNN model, and give a diagnosis and mitotic rate via an OLED screen. This repository is for the software part of the project, where different models are used and experimented with.
